# Retail Demand Forecasting

## Overview

The **Retail Demand Forecasting** project aims to develop an advanced forecasting system for predicting retail product sales using various machine learning models. By analyzing historical sales data, this project builds and evaluates multiple models, such as ARIMA and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to generate accurate sales forecasts.

This repository contains a comprehensive set of tools and workflows for:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Forecasting and visualization
- Performance comparison across models

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-demand-forecasting.git
    cd retail-demand-forecasting
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Project

To run the full forecasting pipeline, execute the `main.py` script. This will load the data, preprocess it, train models, generate forecasts, and display evaluation results.

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the steps defined in `main.py`, utilizing the data and functions from the `src/` folder.

---

### Experimentation Scripts

To explore different aspects of the project, you can run individual experiment scripts located in the `experiments/` folder:

1. **`data_exploration.py`**:  
   Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, visualizing trends, seasonality, and missing values.

    ```bash
    python experiments/data_exploration.py
    ```

2. **`modeling_arima.py`**:  
   Implements the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The script also evaluates the model's performance.

    ```bash
    python experiments/modeling_arima.py
    ```

3. **`modeling_lstm.py`**:  
   Implements an LSTM model for time series forecasting using TensorFlow/Keras.

    ```bash
    python experiments/modeling_lstm.py
    ```

4. **`compare_models.py`**:  
   Compares the results of different models (ARIMA, LSTM) based on evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

    ```bash
    python experiments/compare_models.py
    ```

5. **`hyperparameter_tuning.py`**:  
   Includes code for tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance. This script is optional but recommended for optimizing models.

    ```bash
    python experiments/hyperparameter_tuning.py
    ```

---

## Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on standard forecasting metrics such as:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**

These metrics are calculated for each model and stored in the `outputs/reports/` directory for further analysis.

**Example evaluation report**:
- **ARIMA Model**: RMSE = 12.4, MAE = 8.1
- **LSTM Model**: RMSE = 10.2, MAE = 6.7

---

## Results

After running the scripts, the results are saved in the `outputs/` directory:
- **`plots/`**: Visualizations of the forecast vs actual data, residuals, and model predictions.
- **`reports/`**: A summary of model evaluation metrics, hyperparameter settings, and other relevant reports.

You can find generated plots (such as time series predictions and error residuals) in the `outputs/plots/` folder. Example plots include:

- Forecast vs Actual sales
- Model residuals
- Feature importance graphs (for LSTM models)
